🎓 University Management System (OOP-based) – Python
Welcome to a beginner-friendly Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) project built in Python!
This simple University Management System was developed as part of a class assignment to demonstrate the core OOP principles in a practical, hands-on way.

🔍 Project Overview
This system models a university's basic academic structure using classes and objects. It includes:

👨‍🎓 Students

👨‍🏫 Instructors

📘 Courses

🏢 Department

Each of these is implemented as a Python class with attributes and methods that define their behavior and relationships.

💡 OOP Concepts Demonstrated
This project is designed around the four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming:

Principle	How it's Applied
Encapsulation	Each class encapsulates its own data and related logic
Abstraction	Complex internals (e.g., course enrollment) are hidden behind simple methods
Inheritance	Student and Instructor inherit from the Person base class
Polymorphism	Methods like get_details() can be customized differently in each subclass

🛠️ Features
Assign instructors to courses

Enroll students in courses

Group courses under a department

📚 Why This Project?
This project helped me connect the theory of OOP with real-world design patterns, understand class relationships, and practice clean code structure.

It's a solid base for students who want to move from basic Python to structured, object-oriented development.
